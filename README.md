# Sliding-Puzzle
A simple sliding puzzle game where the aim is to arrange all boxes in numerical order

Version 1.0: Currently, the randomization process can sometimes generate unsolvable games where 2 adjacent boxes have to switch which is impossible by just swapping boxes. This will be solved in the future.
